**# Airline-Management-System**

The Airline Management System is a software that makes the daily operations of airlines more efficient and convenient for customers. Examples of these systems include Sabre Airline Solutions, Amadeus IT Group, and Travelport.

The Airline Management system covers everything from booking flights and managing customer data to tracking flight schedules and updates. By providing a comprehensive solution for the airline industry, these systems aim to streamline processes, improve efficiency, and enhance the customer experience.

The low-level design of the Airline Management System includes functional and non-functional requirements, data structures, algorithms, and interfaces. This blueprint serves as a guide for the development and implementation of the system.

**Functional Requirements**
The following requirements are considered as functional requirements for an Airline Management System:

1. Class Flight: This class stores flight information such as flight number, departure city, arrival city, departure time, arrival time, flight status, and available seats. The class provides accessor functions to retrieve each piece of information. 
2. Class Passenger: This class stores information about a passenger, such as name, booking status, and seat number. The class provides accessor functions to retrieve each piece of information.
3. Class Booking: This class stores information about a booking, such as booking number, passenger information, flight information, and payment details. The class provides accessor functions to retrieve each piece of information. 
4. Class Staff: This class stores information about a staff member, such as name and staff ID. The class provides accessor functions to retrieve each piece of information. 
5. Main Function: The main function creates objects of the classes and retrieves information about flight, passenger, booking, and staff using accessor functions. The retrieved information is displayed on the console.

**Non Functional Requirements**
The following requirements are considered nonfunctional requirements for an Airline Management System: 

1. Scalability: The system should handle an increase in the number of flights, customers, and transactions. 
2. Reliability: The system should be highly reliable and available to customers 24/7. 
3. Performance: The system should be able to provide real-time information and respond to customer requests. 
4. Security: The system should ensure customer information and transactions' confidentiality, integrity, and availability. 
5. User-Friendliness: The system should have a user-friendly interface that is easy to use and navigate. 
6. Interoperability: The system should be able to integrate with other systems and technologies the airline uses.
